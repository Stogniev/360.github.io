The [shopping example][shopping] was a lot of fun to create. Late one night I found a 3D model in [Cinema 4D](http://www.maxon.net/products/cinema-4d-studio/who-should-use-it.html)'s bundled asset library and decided to wrap it in a clothing-shopping layout inspired by a few of my favorite blog designs. Patching this together with curved images and tongue in cheek copy while listening to podcasts was a very fun bit of visual riffing that helped me to tinker with ideas of what VR web design might look like. I'd love to take this one much further, time allowing!
