I'm messing around with A-Frame and learning about textures.

I went over to Flickr and did a [search on `texture` with CC-licensed images](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=textures&license=4%2C5%2C6%2C9%2C10) and came up with [images that Stewart had uploaded a decade ago](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stewart/69979728/in/photolist-7bEx3-7bEbP-7bDUm-7bE3b-k6v2uB-cEpAg7-7bDoa-7bDcs-7bDCE-7bDPm-kH1upF-yZEh3-7bEkJ-7bE7z-9DmLoY-cEpyZC-7bEt4-7bDKF-7bD86-pXNV8d).

Equirectangular images are used a lot, so here's a [CC-licensed search on the Ecquirectangular Group](https://www.flickr.com/search/?group_id=44671723%40N00&view_all=1&license=4%2C5%2C6%2C9%2C10).

My experiment with the A-Frame Boilerplate is hosted on my Github projects [http://projects.bmannconsulting.com/aframe-boilerplate/](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.bmannconsulting.com%2Faframe-boilerplate%2F&t=N2VhNTYyZGEyMTZmYTcxNWU3Yjk5YmNkMmY3M2M2MDZkZDlhYmViMCxvQjBYT2xPQg%3D%3D)

If you visit that link you can use W-A-S-D keys to navigate around, or better yet, open it on your phone and stick it in a VR headset. It's Geocities 1.0 time in VR on the web, but it's great to see Mozilla getting things to the state that we CAN hand-code this sort of thing. I've just been reading through the [A-Frame Primitives documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/primitives/) and getting a feel for what's possible.
