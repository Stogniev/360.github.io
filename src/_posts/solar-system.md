> Designer [Jos&eacute; Manuel](http://www.jmvisualcreativity.es/) is working on an animated interactive representation of our solar system.

This [solar system](http://vrspace.jmvisualcreativity.es/) is a little project that will grow step by step to make a big project. A solar system, following the A-Frame instructions of [animation](https://aframe.io/docs/core/animations.html). I hope you like it. :D
